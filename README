== rrdwrapper
rrdwrapper.rb
rrdwrapper is a wrapper around the rrdtool executable.

At present, rrdwrapper has only been tested on win32. It should work with
minor changes on Linux and Mac. It has been tested with RRDTool v1.2.x.
I haven't tried it with RRDTool v1.3.x as I can't compile it on win32. :-)

Note: the rrdpath variable cannot use a path with a colon.
rrdtool uses the colon as a delimiter in some fields.
The rrdpath needs to be on the same drive where the program is running

TODO - not all rrdtool functions have been implemented
