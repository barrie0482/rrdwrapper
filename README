== rrdwrapper
rrdwrapper.rb
rrdwrapper is a wrapper around the rrdtool executable.

At present, rrdwrapper has only been tested on win32. It should work with
minor changes on Linux and Mac. It has been tested with RRDTool v1.2.x.
I haven't tried it with RRDTool v1.3.x as I can't compile it on win32. :-)

TODO - not all rrdtool functions have been implemented
